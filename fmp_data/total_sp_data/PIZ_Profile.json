        "description": "PIZ searches for outperformance in developed markets outside the US based on a trend-following index from Dorsey Wright. In its attempt to beat the market, the fund favors large cap securities, and those eligible for index inclusion are assigned a relative strength score. Approximately 100 of these securities with the greatest scores will form the Underlying Index. Component weights are also based on relative scores, wherein higher scoring-securities receive larger weights. PIZ is also less volatile than some alpha-seekers. Its liquid basket also allows for straightforward block execution. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly. Prior to August 28, 2023, the fund traded under the name Invesco DWA Developed Markets Momentum ETF.",
