Welcome to **FinSight** – your comprehensive tool for comparing traditional regression methods with LLM-based prediction models for financial data.

---

## 🔧 **Initial Setup**

### **Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system
   - Ensure ports 8501 (Streamlit) and 11434 (Ollama) are available

2. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This will start:
   - Streamlit frontend (accessible at `http://localhost:8501`)
   - Ollama container for LLM functionality

3. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
   - The application will automatically connect to the containerized Ollama instance

### **Option 2: Local Deployment**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.8 or higher
   - Install Ollama locally from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m src.backend.launch
   ```

4. **Configure Ollama Connection:**
   - Go to **Settings → Global Settings**
   - Enable "Local Ollama" toggle
   - Enter your Ollama URL (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
   - Click "Test connection" to verify

## ⚙️ **Required Configuration**

### **1. Ollama Setup (LLM Backend)**

**Why needed:** All LLM features (LLM Playground, Assistant) require Ollama.

**Setup Steps:**

#### **For Docker Users:**
- **No action required** – Ollama runs automatically in the container
- Default connection: `http://ollama:11434`

#### **For Local Installation:**
1. Navigate to **Settings → Assistant Settings**
2. Select "Local Ollama" under "Change Source"
3. Test the connection
4. Download a model (recommended: `phi3:mini` for lightweight or `llama3.1:8b` for better quality)

**Model Selection:**
- Go to **Settings → Assistant Settings → Assistant Model Management**
- Choose from suggested models or enter a custom model name
- Click "⬇️ Download" to install the model
- Wait for download completion (may take several minutes depending on model size)

**Available Models:**
| Model | Size | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| phi3:mini | 3.8B | Lightweight tasks, fast responses |
| llama3.1:8b | 8B | General-purpose, good quality |
| llama3.2:3b | 3B | Low-resource environments |
| mistral | 7B | Balanced performance |
| qwen2 | up to 72B | Complex tasks, multilingual |

### **2. Alpha Vantage API Key (Data Downloads)**

### **3. Initial Ticker List (Optional but Recommended)**

**Why configure:** Define which stocks are loaded by default.

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to **Settings → Data Settings → Initial Tickers loading**
2. **Option A:** Use the default ticker list (400+ US stocks)
3. **Option B:** Create custom list:
   - Select tickers from the dropdown
   - Add custom tickers (comma-separated) in the text field
   - Click "Choose as New Initial Tickers"
4. Click "Load initial Data" to download the selected stocks

## 📊 **Data**

The Data page is your starting point for stock analysis and data management.

### **Single Stock Analysis**
Analyze individual stocks in detail:
- Current metrics and fundamental data
- Price development with interactive charts
- Historical performance metrics

### **Compared Stock Analysis**
Compare multiple stocks directly to identify relative performance and correlations.

### **Sidebar Functions**

#### 🔄 **Update All Data**
Automatically downloads the latest information for all stocks marked as "Initial" in your ticker list.

#### 📦 **Update Processed Data**
Manually transfers metrics into the processed database (only necessary if automatic processing fails).

#### 🎯 **Update Single Ticker Data**
Update specific tickers from your existing list. *Note: Check the last update timestamp to know your data status.*

#### 📥 **Download Ticker Data**
Search for and download new stocks into your database.

**⚠️ Important:** All download functions require an **Alpha Vantage API Key**, which must be configured under **Settings → Global Settings** (stored only for the current session).

### **Create Your Own Database**
Create custom databases from Excel or CSV files:
- Drag and drop or browse files (CSV, Excel, up to 200MB)
- Assign individual database names
- Choose conflict strategy:
  - **Fail:** Abort if table exists (safe)
  - **Replace:** Overwrite existing data (destructive)
  - **Append:** Add new rows to existing table
- Manage created databases under **Settings → Data Settings → Clear Table**

3. **Model Selection:** Larger, specialized models deliver better results but require more resources
4. **Resource Management:** Use row limits in ML Studio to optimize performance
5. **Custom Databases:** Test different data combinations for personalized analyses
6. **Ollama Connection:** Always test your Ollama connection before starting analyses
7. **Rate Limits:** Be mindful of Alpha Vantage limits (5 calls/minute, 500/day)
8. **Data Quality:** Check data completeness before training models

## 🔧 **Technical Notes**

- All LLM functions use **Ollama** as backend
- When running without Docker, select "Local Ollama" in the settings
- For external Ollama instances, use IP-based configuration
- The platform executes calculations without logic validation – method selection is the user's responsibility
- LLM responses are qualitative and non-deterministic
- Larger datasets may cause loading delays
- Session state is not persistent across restarts
- User databases are stored in `users_database.db`
- System databases are in `data/` directory

---

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Start application (Docker or local)
   - Configure Ollama connection
   - Download Assistant model
   - Enter Alpha Vantage API key

2. **Load Data:**
   - Set initial ticker list (Settings)
   - Click "Load initial Data"
   - Execute "Update All Data"
   - Verify data in Database tab

3. **Exploration:**
   - Use Single Stock Analysis to verify data quality
   - Test Compared Stock Analysis
   - Familiarize with available metrics

4. **Modeling:**
   - Experiment with ML Studio (simple model first)
   - Try LLM Playground with different prediction types
   - Compare results between ML and LLM

5. **Iteration:**
   - Refine features based on results
   - Test different algorithms

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Ollama Connection Failed**
- Docker: Ensure container is running (`docker ps`)
- Local: Check if Ollama is installed and running
- Verify URL in Settings → Global Settings
- Test connection button should show green status

### **Assistant Not Responding**
- Check Ollama connection status
- Verify model is downloaded (Settings → Assistant Settings)
- Try smaller model if timeout occurs
- Increase timeout in LLM Playground settings

### **Data Download Fails**
- Verify Alpha Vantage API key is entered
- Check if rate limit is exceeded (wait 1 minute)
- Ensure internet connection
- Check ticker symbol is valid

### **ML Training Errors**
- Verify data source is loaded (check row count > 0)
- Ensure features and target are selected
- Check for NaN values in data
- Verify minimum row requirement is met (Settings → ML Settings)

### **LLM Analysis Takes Too Long**
- Use smaller model (phi3:mini instead of llama3.1:8b)
- Reduce data sample size
- Increase timeout in sidebar
- Check system resources (RAM/CPU usage)
